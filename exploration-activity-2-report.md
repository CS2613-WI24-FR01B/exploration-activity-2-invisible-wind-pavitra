# Exploratory Activity 1

## Section 1: Which package/library did you select?
   The package/library selected is Turtle within Python.
## Section 2:  What is the package/library?
Jest is a "JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity [1]". Jest has the capability to work with projects using "Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue, and more! [1]". Jest is useful because it "aims to work out of the boc, config free, on most JavaScript projects [1] ". Moreover, Jest helps "make tests which keep track of large objects with ease [1]". Jest has the capability to "run tests in parallel" because it "ensures" that the "tests have unique global state" [1]. Jest "uses a customer resolver for imports in" the "tests", which "makes it simple to mock any object outside of your test's scope" [1].  

## Section 3: What are the functionalities of the package/library?
There are different functions that Jest offers some of which include:

`describe (name, fn)`: This is used to "create a block that groups together several related tests [2]".

`toBe(value)`: This is used to "compare primitive values or to check referential identity of object instances. [3]".

`toHaveBeenCalled()`: This is used to "ensure that a mock function was called [3]".

`toHaveBeenCalledTimes(number)`: This is used to "ensure that a mock function got called exact number of times [3]".

`toHaveReturned()`: This is used to "test that the mock function successfully returned ... atleast one time [3]".

`toHaveLength(number)`: This is used to "check that an object has a .length property and it is set to a certain numeric value [3]".

`toHaveProperty(keyPath, value?)`: This is used to "check if properly at provided reference keyPath exists for an object [3]".

`toBeCloseTo(number, numDigits?)`: This is used to "compare floating point numbers for approximate equality [3]".


## Section 4: When was it created?
The Jest framework was "created in 2011" by "Meta" [4].

## Section 5: Why did you select this package/library?
I selected Jest because I wanted to gain a deep understanding of testing code written in JavaScript. Jest has helped me test my code written in JavaScript.  

## Section 6: How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
Learning Jest a library in JavaScript influenced my learning of JavaScript and Jest in a positive manner. Now, I feel confident in the code I have written in JavaScript because there is an easy way to test the functionality of the code. By writing a few test cases in Jest, I am able to check if I have implemented my JavaScript code in the right manner. Moreover, I have gained a deep understanding of the different ways in which tests are written in Jest. I have understood the importance of grouping certain test cases and using `expect` to write useful tests. 

## Section 7: How was your overall experience with the package/library?
Overall, my experience was great. The application program that I created using Jest and JavaScript really sharpened my understanding of this library and JavaScript. It was a great learning experience because I got an opportunity to learn a new library and I combined the functions offered by the library with the programming fundamentals of JavaScript to build an exciting program that allows users to buy books and test the functionality of the application.
